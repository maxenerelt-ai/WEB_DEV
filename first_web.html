        <h1>Skateboarding</h1>
        <h2>How to get started with Skating?</h2>
        <p>Skateboarding can be done by anyone anywhere its compatibility with budget and room makes it a big sport for alot of people.</p>
        <p>To get started you need atleast some room even just a slab on concrete works, you also need a skateboard (more on what type later), you can get protection if you want not neccesarily needed, and final thing you need is good durable shoes as they get worn down alot from tricks.</p>
        <h2>What board should you get?</h2>
        <p>Go to your local skate shop as they have the most reliable and most skate shops are cheaper then commercial shops like zumies</p>
        <p>1.Get a deck with something you like on it (personal suggestion is a creature or hockey deck), skateboards come in different sizes get one generally 8.25 is a great choice if your under 6'</p>
        <p>2.Get some trucks focus on more reliable trucks as these are what hold your wheels</p>
        <p>3.Get some wheels they can go from 120 which are really hard wheels which are not recommened idk even know what they where made for. I would recommend getting spitfire 92's they are soft for rolling smoothly and also not to soft to getting flat spots.</p>
        <p>4.Get some bearings they are what make the wheel spin get ones that roll nicely as you wont have to push as much</p>
        <p>5.Get some griptape as its what will help you grip to the board and do all your tricks</p>
